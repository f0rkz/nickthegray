# Background 🤓

📼 From a young age I was fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together. The desire to know more about the machine outweighed the need for a working machine. I have fond memories taking apart electronics just to figure out how they worked. I had a love for rockets and space, and aspired to be an astronaut. From then on I have always been fascinated with engineering principles to construct systems and maybe get to space one day😉.

🏃 In highschool I started studying CCNA and found a fascination with networking. I joined FBLA with a focus in networking. My highschool networking team went to state finals where we won second place in network design. I was hooked. I needed more of this networking and server thing.

📖 College felt generic to me and left me desiring more. I started looking for a job in the IT industry to get my feet wet.

💾 I found a job at a local data center, [Cyber Wurx](https://cyberwurx.com/), working the help desk. Web hosting had not moved primarily to "the cloud" yet, so there was a large amount of website business to be had. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting Debian systems in the managed hosting environment, building new data center cabinets, and running cables/fibers. Through laziness and curiosity, I found out better ways to automate the tedious stuff with perl, bash, and python.

👶 I had my first son! Happy days! Time to find stability!

📨 As the years went by, my skills were hardened more. I picked up networking as a skill and maintained and enhanced BGP and OSPF networks on Cisco Catalyst and Brocade/Foundry BigIron. I started using php and dreaming of better days with automation and web tools to make my life easier. I learned configuration automation for systems, starting with puppet and moving along to chef. I learned ruby in an effort to hone my Chef skills. Python became a necessity tool in my tool chain.

👶 I had my second son. Time to find something more to support them better!

📀 I finally felt complete as an engineer from my earlier development and moved on to become a DevOps Engineer at [Pindrop](https://pindrop.com), where I am now. In my early days there my time was spent writing and enhancing chef cookbooks and building systems for software engineers. As the needs for tooling became clear, I started developing tools for various tedious tasks. My DevOps skills hardened over time to shape me into the engineer I am today.

👶 I had my first daughter. Time to get old!

☁ (now) I am a Principal DevOps Engineer at [Pindrop](https://pindrop.com) today!👋 My time is spent solving complicated problems with technology and figuring out how to have fun in the process. I have taken place in many workplace culture activities like Pindrop's Tea Time. I enjoy teaching my skills to up and coming engineers that want to learn the ways of the DevOps. I am very fortunate to be able to share my skills with anyone willing to learn!
