# Hello, Nick the Gray welcomes you! 👋

Hi there! My name is Nick Gray. I am a Principal DevOps Engineer with specialization in automation.

I strive for excellence in stable and reliable infrastructure.

## Background 🤓

🧮 💾 💿 📀 ☁

📼 From a young age I was fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together.
The desire to know more about the machine outweighed the need for a working machine. I have fond memories
taking apart an old stereo just to find out how a radio worked. From then on I have always been fascinated
with engineering principles to construct systems.

💾 I then found a job at a local data center, [Cyber Wurx](https://cyberwurx.com/), working the help desk. Web hosting had not moved
primarily to the cloud yet, so there was a large amount of website business to be had. I spent a lot of time troubleshooting
Debian systems through our managed hosting environment, to figuring out better ways to automate the tedious stuff with perl, bash, and python.

📨 As the years went by, my skills were hardened more. I picked up networking as a skill and maintained and enhanced BGP and OSPF networks
on Cisco Catalyst and Brocade/Foundry BigIron. I started using php and dreaming of better days with automation and web tools to make my life easier.
I learned configuration automation for systems, starting with puppet and moving along to chef. I learned ruby in an effort to hone my Chef skills.
Python became a necessity tool in my tool chain.

📀 I finally felt complete as an engineer from my earlier development and moved on to become a DevOps Engineer at [Pindrop](https://pindrop.com), where I am now.
In my early days there my time was spent writing and enhancing chef cookbooks and building systems for software engineers. As the needs for tooling became clear,
I started developing tools for various tedious tasks. My DevOps skills hardened over time to shape me into the engineer I am today.

☁ I am a Principal DevOps Engineer at [Pindrop](https://pindrop.com) today! 👋
